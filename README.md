# ALU PROJECT

- INTRODUCTION 
- The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a fundamental combinational circuit at the heart of any digital 
processor. This project involves designing a parameterized ALU using Verilog HDL, capable of 
performing both arithmetic and logical operations. The design incorporates operations such as 
addition, subtraction, increment, decrement, logical shifts, rotates, and various logical gates, 
making it suitable for diverse computing applications.
